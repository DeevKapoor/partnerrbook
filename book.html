          When the storm of the future comes to test our bond, the road seems
          rocky, and the distance threatens to tear us apart, I am sure the
          memories we will build together, will be strong enough to help us win
          over these challenges.
          I want to live, grow, hit old age, love, be successful, learn and be happy with you, only you, my loveüíï.

          how blessed I feel to be around you. Thank you for everything,my partner.

          one of the biggest reasons I could find my calling and follow my
          dreams. I must have done some good deeds in my previous life because,
          in this one, I have found a gem of a best friend,as partner.

          I was dead, you are my saviour. I miss when someone misunderstands me because you
          are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or

          you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about
          all the times we have spent with one another because I cherish those
          comforting memories always, I want to make ky life best with having you in it as my life partner,and forever the part of my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è.
